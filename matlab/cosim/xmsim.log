xmsim: *W,DSEM2009: This SystemVerilog design is simulated as per IEEE 1800-2009 SystemVerilog simulation semantics. Use -disable_sem2009 option for turning off SV 2009 simulation semantics.
************************************************************************
HDL server has been started in batch mode. The HDL simulator will be 
blocked until Simulink starts cosimulation. If you do not want to run
in batch mode, restart the HDL simulator in a different run mode. To 
exit the HDL simulator without running a cosimulation session, issue 
the breakHdlSim('35463') command in MATLAB.
